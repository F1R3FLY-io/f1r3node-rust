# Slashing — Formal Specification and Verification

This directory contains the **complete formal specification and machine-checked
verification of the slashing logic** in the F1r3fly CBC Casper consensus
implementation. The work establishes observational bisimilarity at the process
level between the Rust slashing logic in this repository and the Scala original
from which it was migrated, with explicit, proven *bug-fix deltas* where the
Scala source is faulty.

> **Audit corpus preserved separately.** The full audit methodology, Sage
> search corpus, traceability ledger, search-horizon program, and all three
> mechanized proof stacks (Rocq, TLA+, Sage models) are preserved on the
> `analysis/slashing` branch. This branch (`feature/slashing`) keeps the
> normative and design surface plus the self-contained
> `slashing-verification.md` mathematical article. Citations below that
> reference the audit corpus or mechanized proofs by file path point at the
> preserved-on-`analysis/slashing` artifacts.

## Reading order

1. **`design/`** — *Pedagogical design document set* (17 files:
   15 numbered chapters + `14a-tier-architecture.md` + `README.md`,
   in intuitively-named subsections). Read first if you are an
   engineer or auditor approaching the slashing subsystem for the
   first time and want to understand *what each component is, what it
   does, how it does it, and why it was chosen*. Each section leads
   with intuition, then formal definition, then literate-pseudocode
   algorithm, then example, then rationale and references.
   See [`design/README.md`](./design/README.md) for the
   reading order within the design document set.
2. **`slashing-specification.md`** — *Normative contract.* Read second if you
   are an implementer, auditor, or validator operator. Defines components,
   message-passing semantics, the validator lifecycle, the bisimilarity
   statement, the bug-fix manifest, and the use-case catalog. Cites theorems
   by name and `file:line` anchor into the verification doc.
3. **`slashing-verification.md`** — *Proof artifact.* Read third if you are a
   formal-methods reviewer or certifier. A self-contained mathematical article
   stating every theorem with its prose proof, the TLA+ model summary, the
   Rocq↔TLA+ correspondence table, and the trust base. Citations to
   `formal/rocq/slashing/`, `formal/tlaplus/slashing/`, and
   `formal/sage/slashing/` point at the mechanized sources preserved on
   `analysis/slashing`.
4. **`slashing-threat-model.md`** — *Defensive threat catalog.* Read alongside
   the verification doc to see every modeled attack surface and the protection
   mechanism that covers it. The cross-reference column points at Rust artifacts
   on this branch; Rocq/TLA+/Sage artifacts cited there live on
   `analysis/slashing`.
5. **`diagrams/`** — PlantUML sources and rendered SVGs for the 11 diagrams
   referenced in the spec. Each is embedded inline at its first relevant
   mention in the spec/verification docs; the visuals and the LTS rules
   are designed to stay 1:1.

   Diagram 01 is the **exhaustive** component diagram; Diagram 10 is
   the **proof-bearing subset** (components with Rocq theorems and/or
   TLA+ models). Both are correct, just at different scopes.

## Headline claims (proved)

- **T-1 / T-2.** Equivocation detection is sound and complete with respect to the
  intended semantics.
- **T-7.** A successful `SlashDeploy` zeros the offender's bond and reward,
  removes them from the active validator set, and transfers the forfeited stake
  to the Coop vault.
- **T-11 / T-12.** Two-level slashing terminates, has exact
  reverse-reachability closure semantics, and preserves count-weighted and
  stake-weighted quorum under the stated closure bounds.
- **T-12C / T-12I / T-12F / T-12G / T-12A / T-12V.** Fixed-point
  closure certificates, active-quorum intersection, current-validator
  and epoch filtering, evidence visibility/report suppression,
  view-indexed closure, duplicate-edge idempotence, cycle edge cases,
  projection-risk witnesses, and safe arithmetic envelopes are stated
  and proved in `slashing-verification.md`; the underlying Rocq and TLA+
  mechanizations are preserved on `analysis/slashing`.
- **T-12PF / T-5DF.** Hypothesis-backed Sage search results (preserved on
  `analysis/slashing`) reduce proposer evidence-inclusion fairness and
  delimiter-free record-key collisions to deterministic witnesses, promoted
  to theorems in `slashing-verification.md` and use cases in the spec.
- **T-12HYP / deep Sage threat modeling.** Hypothesis frontier and Sage
  threat-ranking results (preserved on `analysis/slashing`) explore
  partition/gossip schedules, objective-guided campaigns, production-shaped
  DAG traces, defensive adversarial vulnerability campaigns, precondition
  fuzzing, Rust replay fixtures, graph attack paths, stake damage,
  retention/pruning, epoch/churn, arithmetic envelopes, exact-vs-runtime
  projection matrices, differential-oracle rows, mutation/metamorphic
  variants, and objective-frontier fixture selection; all findings classify
  as documented boundary, projection-risk, or assumption-counterexample
  witnesses on the audit branch before promotion to this branch.
- **T-9.12–T-9.15.** Current-epoch slash authorization, unknown/stale slash
  evidence no-op behavior, checked sequence arithmetic, and duplicate
  justification rejection are stated and proved in `slashing-verification.md`.
- **T-15.** Under the documented bug fixes, the Rust implementation is
  observationally bisimilar to the Scala original — i.e., no observable
  divergence remains.

## Building and verifying

The mechanized Rocq proofs, TLA+ model-checking instances, and Sage models
live on the `analysis/slashing` branch. On that branch, build with:

```sh
# Rocq proofs (use systemd-run resource limits per CLAUDE.md)
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=96G -p CPUQuota=1800% \
            -p IOWeight=30 -p TasksMax=200 \
            make -C formal/rocq/slashing -j1

# TLA+ model checking
cd formal/tlaplus/slashing
tlc -workers 12 MC_EquivocationDetector.tla
tlc -workers 12 MC_ConcurrentTracker.tla
tlc -workers 12 MC_SlashFlow.tla
tlc -workers 12 MC_TwoLevelSlashing.tla
tlc -workers 12 MC_AuthorizedSlashFlow.tla
```

On `feature/slashing` (this branch), only the diagram-rendering and
cross-link check are runnable:

```sh
# PlantUML rendering (SVGs are committed; this regenerates them)
for puml in docs/theory/slashing/diagrams/*.puml; do
  plantuml -tsvg "$puml"
done

# Cross-link sanity check
./scripts/check-doc-links.sh
```
