# Continued GSLTs / Cost Endofunctor — Correspondence Map

**Status:** Implementation-aligned correspondence record
**Governing papers (READ-ONLY law):**
- `publications/cost-accounting/cost-accounted-rho.tex` — the concrete cost-accounted rho calculus.
- `publications/cost-accounting-as-monad/continued-gslt-cost-v2.tex` — *"Continued Interactive GSLTs and the
  Cost Endofunctor"* (the categorical construction, *one level up*).

This document maps each construct of the monad paper to the artifact that realizes it in `f1r3node-rust`,
across Rocq, Rust, TLA+, Sage, and Lean. It is the alignment record for "fully support
`continued-gslt-cost-v2`." See [DR-21](cost-accounting-decision-records.md) (the executed native four-sort
migration + the conditional-SN finding) and [DR-20](cost-accounting-decision-records.md) (the GAP enumeration).

The decisive enabling move is the **native four-sort grammar** (DR-21): `for`/`send` continuations are signed
terms (the wrapped-term sort 𝕋), so "signed terms pervade the syntax" is native and "every redex sits inside a
wrapper" is a sorting invariant — the paper's *wrapping by construction*. The pure rho `proc`/`name` of
`RhoSyntax.v` is kept unchanged as the translation target (carrier split).

## Runtime correspondence (zero behavioral change)

The native migration adds **no new runtime behavior** (verified); the existing runtime already realizes the
monad-paper concepts:

| Paper concept | Runtime artifact |
|---|---|
| Unit η(P) = {P}_∅ (cost-free fragment) | `accounting/mod.rs` `RuntimeBudget::unmetered` / s₀-collapse |
| Lazy metering (charge when forced, not exposed) | per-COMM charge in `reduce.rs` / `metering.rs` (DR-9) |
| Located purses / disjoint per-surface pools | `accounting/mod.rs` per-signature `DashMap<Sig,…>` lane pool |
| Graded transitions (step labelled by consumed signature) | `BillableTokenEvent.sig_hash` |
| Generic GSLT/OSLF funding boundary | `accounting/resource_logic.rs` `GsltPresentation`, `ResourceSignature`, `OslfResourceLogic<G>`; native specialization `RhoGslt` |
| Two monoids (spatial vs temporal) | spatial `Par` (unordered) vs temporal `SourcePath` (ordered) |

MeTTaIL is not a Rust runtime dependency in this design. When `mettail-rust` is ready, integration should be
an adapter that implements the generic `GsltPresentation`/`ResourceSignature`/`OslfResourceLogic<G>` surface
and plugs into the injected acceptance/replay entry points. The native node remains coupled to the
specification-level GSLT/OSLF interface, not to a specific MeTTaIL implementation.

## Honestly Rocq-primary (now mechanized)

Per the multi-prover allocation (DR-21 (d), and the design table): some claims are equational/logical and
Rocq-primary, with TLA+/Sage/Lean carrying genuine content only where there is operational/algebraic substance
(monad laws → Sage + Lean; located purses + modulus → TLA+). The two categorical claims that rest on the
**native translation / bisimulation** (the source-to-source erasure into pure rho) are now discharged
axiom-free in the native four-sort grammar:

- **Graded Hennessy–Milner adequacy** (graded-HML equivalence = graded bisimulation over the
  signature-labelled `graded_step`):
  - *soundness* — `CAGradedAdequacy.graded_adequacy_sound` (graded-bisimilar ⇒ same graded-HML);
  - *image-finiteness* — `CAGradedImageFinite.graded_image_finite` and `CAGradedSuccPairs.graded_image_finite_pairs`
    (the explicit finite successor enumerations `graded_succ` / `graded_succ_all`);
  - *completeness* — `CAGradedCompleteness.graded_finitary_adequacy`: at every finite modal depth `n`,
    depth-`n` graded bisimilarity ⟺ agreement on all graded-HML formulae of modal depth ≤ `n`, via the
    constructive `graded_dichotomy` (distinguishing-formula extraction). **No Classical / funext / Choice** —
    image-finiteness removes the only non-constructive obstacle.
  - *full (non-stratified) HM theorem* — `CAGradedLimit.graded_limit_adequacy`: `(∀n, graded_bisim_n n S T)
    ⟺ (∀φ, gsat S φ ↔ gsat T φ)` — approximant-limit graded bisimilarity = graded-HML equivalence, with no
    depth bound. `graded_bisim_refines_approximants` bridges the coinductive gfp (`CAGradedAdequacy.graded_bisim`)
    into the limit (`graded_bisim_implies_hml`). The one implication NOT proven — approximant-limit ⇒ coinductive
    gfp — is exactly the image-finite infinite pigeonhole (a weak omniscience principle); it is stated and assumed
    **nowhere**, so the whole stack stays axiom-free. This is the precise constructive ceiling, exhibited as theorems.
  - *force-point obstruction, proven* — `CAForceSeparation.ca_force_overgating_separation` (+ `_nonvacuous`):
    the gated translation `St (STSigned P s)` is stuck (`gated_translation_stuck`), so it is **not** strongly
    bisimilar to the dequoted-and-running source force `Pt (st_to_proc (STSigned P s))`. The "full metered
    bisimulation at force points" is thus a machine-checked **FALSE-for-the-naive-translation** result, not an
    open task; a force-faithful translation is a different (out-of-scope) translation.
- **The two adjunctions** — Free ⊣ Forget (structural) in `CAAdjunctions.v`
  (`cost_forget_install`, `cost_install_forget_alters`, naturality), and the internalisation
  ℐ_G ≡ `Imp_G : Cost(G) → G` over Turing-complete bases in `CAInternalisation.v`. The latter is the paper's
  Prop. `adj2` (*internalisation as an adjoint retraction*): `ca_internalisation_retraction` proves
  `Imp_G ∘ η_G ≈ id_G` **up to weak bisimulation** — the retraction along the cost-free unit embedding `η_G`,
  where the freely-available unit token fires the gate as an administrative reduction (so the §3a force-point
  over-gating, a property of the *full metered* translation at arbitrary grades, is not in scope of the claim).
  Axiom-free and fully general over the hash/ground encoders.

The central structural claims (wrapping, the cost monad, GAP-2 dissolution, cost determinism, the modulus) are
discharged axiom-free by `continued_gslt_cost_capstone`; the graded adequacy and both adjunctions above complete
the categorical layer (CL5–CL6) in the native grammar.
