# Crate: casper (Consensus Layer)

**Path**: `casper/`

CBC Casper consensus: block creation, validation, DAG management, safety oracle, and finalization.

## Core Traits

```rust
pub trait Casper {
    // Snapshot of current consensus state
    fn get_snapshot() -> Result<CasperSnapshot, CasperError>;
    // Block validation
    fn validate_block(block: &BlockMessage, snapshot: &CasperSnapshot)
        -> Result<BlockStatus, CasperError>;
    // Deploy management
    fn add_deploy(deploy: Signed<DeployData>) -> Result<(), CasperError>;
}

pub trait MultiParentCasper: Casper {
    // DAG operations
    fn dag() -> &BlockDagKeyValueStorage;
    // Block proposal
    fn propose(snapshot: &CasperSnapshot) -> Result<ProposeResult, CasperError>;
}

pub trait Engine: Send + Sync {
    // State machine progression
    fn handle_message(msg: CasperMessage) -> Result<(), CasperError>;
}
```

## CasperSnapshot

State captured at discrete block intervals:

```rust
pub struct CasperSnapshot {
    pub dag: KeyValueDagRepresentation,
    pub last_finalized_block: BlockHash,
    pub lca: BlockHash,
    pub tips: Vec<BlockHash>,
    pub parents: Vec<BlockMessage>,
    pub justifications: HashSet<Justification>,
    pub invalid_blocks: HashMap<Validator, BlockHash>,
    pub deploys_in_scope: HashSet<Signed<DeployData>>,
    pub max_block_num: i64,
    pub max_seq_nums: HashMap<Validator, u64>,
    pub on_chain_state: OnChainCasperState,
}
```

## Block Creation Flow

1. **Deploy selection** (`prepare_user_deploys`):
   - Read unfinalized deploys from storage
   - Filter by validity window (block number, expiration timestamp)
   - Exclude deploys already in scope (prevent duplication)
   - Remove expired deploys
   - **Adaptive deploy cap**: EMA-based controller dynamically adjusts per-block deploy count to maintain a 1-second latency target. Parameters are hardcoded (target: 1000ms, min cap: 1, small batch bypass: 3 deploys, backlog floor enabled with trigger: 2, divisor: 2, min: 2, max: 8). Small batches bypass the cap. A backlog floor mechanism prevents deploy starvation when many deploys are pending.

2. **System deploy preparation**:
   - Slashing deploys (punish equivocators)
   - Close block deploys (finalize state)

3. **Block assembly**:
   - Header: version, timestamp, sender, block number, post-state hash
   - Body: state, processed deploys, rejected deploys, system deploys
   - Justifications, bonds cache
   - Block hash via Blake2b256
   - Sign with validator's Secp256k1 key
   - **Timestamp hardening**: Guards against i64 overflow in timestamp conversion. If current time < max parent timestamp (clock skew), clamps to parent timestamp to avoid `InvalidTimestamp` validation errors.

4. **Self-validation**:
   - Pre/post-state hash mismatches return `BlockError::BlockException` instead of panicking (replaced `assert!` with proper error returns)

## Block Validation

**`BlockProcessor` pipeline**:
1. Check interest (shard match, version, not old)
2. Format and signature validation
3. Dependency resolution (fetch missing parents)
4. Full validation with CasperSnapshot:
   - Block number progression
   - Sender weight verification
   - Repeat deploy detection
   - Parent validity
   - Justification consistency
   - Bonds cache correctness
   - Equivocation checks (simple + neglected)
   - Timestamp/expiration validation
   - Deploy execution and state hash verification

**`BlockStatus`**: `Valid(ValidBlock)` or `Error(BlockError)`

**`InvalidBlock`**: 25+ variants covering equivocation, format, signature, timing, sequence, deploy validity issues.

## Fork Choice (LMD GHOST)

**Estimator** implements Latest Message Driven Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree:
1. Calculate Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of all latest messages
2. Score each latest message from LCA downward
3. Rank and select non-conflicting subset with highest score
4. Constraints: `max_number_of_parents`, `max_parent_depth`

## Safety Oracle (Clique Oracle)

Computes normalized fault tolerance between -1.0 and 1.0:
1. Get weight map (stakes) from main parent
2. Filter validators agreeing on target message
3. Compute maximum clique of non-disagreeing validators
4. Formula: `(2 * maxCliqueWeight - totalStake) / totalStake`
5. If agreeing weight <= 50%, return MIN_FAULT_TOLERANCE (-1.0)

## Finalization

**Finalizer** scoped search from last finalized block (LFB) to tips:
1. Find blocks with >50% stake agreement via main parent chain
2. Execute Clique Oracle on candidates
3. Output first block exceeding fault tolerance threshold
4. Guarded by `FinalizationInProgress` atomic bool (prevents snapshot creation during finalization)

## Equivocation Detection

| Type | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Simple | Direct double-sign at same sequence number | Rejected |
| Admissible | Block conflicts but referenced via justification | Allowed |
| Ignorable | Standalone conflict | Rejected, not slashed |
| Neglected | Failure to slash known equivocation | Block invalid |

## Engine State Machine

- `Initializing` -- Waiting for approved block
- `GenesisValidator` -- Genesis ceremony
- `GenesisCeremony` -- Multi-sig approval
- `Running` -- Normal consensus

## Merging

`merging/dag_merger.rs` -- Multi-parent state merging for blocks with multiple parents.

### Parent State Merge

When a block has multiple parents (selected by the fork choice rule), the node must compute a merged post-state before executing new deploys. The merge procedure:

1. **Find the LCA** (Lowest Common Ancestor) of the parent blocks in the DAG.
2. **Determine visible blocks** -- all blocks between the LCA and the parents (exclusive of LCA, inclusive of parents).
3. **Run ConflictSetMerger** -- collects deploys from visible blocks, detects conflicts (deploys touching overlapping channels), and resolves them deterministically.

### LCA-Scoped Merge

The merge scope is limited to blocks at or above the LCA. Blocks below the LCA are common ancestors whose state is already reflected in the LCA's post-state -- replaying them would be redundant and expensive. Because the LCA is derived purely from DAG structure (parent pointers and block heights), every validator computes the same LCA for the same set of parent blocks.

### Determinism Constraint

The merge scope cannot rely on local finalization status because different validators may have temporarily different finalized views. A validator that has finalized block B and one that has not must still compute the same merge result for identical parent sets. Using block height and LCA (both derived from the immutable DAG) ensures this.

**Deterministic ordering**: Merge paths in `conflict_set_merger.rs` and casper-buffer eviction enforce deterministic tie-breaks to ensure consistent behavior across nodes.

### Performance

Merge cost is O(visible_blocks^2 x deploys^2) for the conflict resolution phase, dominated by pairwise conflict detection across deploys in the visible block set. LCA scoping keeps the visible block count bounded, preventing merge cost from degrading under sustained load.

### Fallback

If the visible block count exceeds `MAX_PARENT_MERGE_SCOPE_BLOCKS` (512) or the LCA distance exceeds `MAX_LCA_DISTANCE_BLOCKS` (256), the merge falls back to the latest parent's post-state. This caps worst-case merge latency at the cost of discarding deploys from non-selected parents, which will be re-proposed in subsequent blocks.

## Tests

Feature-gated `test_utils` module (`#[cfg(feature = "test-utils")]`) provides test infrastructure: `helper/` (test_node, block_generator, block_dag_storage_fixture, block_util, bonding_util, no_ops_casper_effect) and `util/` (genesis_builder, test_mocks, rholang/resources, comm/transport_layer_test_impl). Integration tests for block_report_api and reporting_casper.
