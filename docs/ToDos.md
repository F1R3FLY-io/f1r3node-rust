    status: complete
    acceptance:

      - "DEVELOPER.md and docker/README.md updated"

  - id: TASK-001-3

    status: complete
    acceptance:

      - "observer.yml and validator4.yml reference f1r3fly-shard as external network"

  - id: TASK-001-4
    title: "Verify shard starts with updated genesis and network config"
    status: complete
    claimed_by: claude-session-epoch009
    completed_at: 2026-04-13T20:55:00Z
    blocked_by: []
    acceptance:
      - "docker compose -f docker/shard.yml up succeeds"
      - "Genesis ceremony completes with 20-wallet wallets.txt"
      - "Observer and validator4 can join via f1r3fly-shard network"
    notes:
      - "All 3 written ACs verified end-to-end with locally built f1r3fly-rust:local image"
      - "Bonding extension also verified: added validator4's REV address (1111La6tHaCt...jtEi3M) to wallets.txt as genesis funding, then deployed bond.rho signed by validator4, propose included in block with errored=false and cost=167749 phlo, bond-status flipped to 'Validator is bonded', validator4 proceeded to produce 6+ blocks via heartbeat"
      - "Root cause of earlier insufficient-funds error: validator4.yml was designed for runtime bonding but validator4's REV address was never added to genesis wallets.txt. Fix is a single-line addition."
      - "REV-address computation done via `node eval` on 1.know_ones_vaultaddress.rho (output in docker stdout of the evaluating node)"
---
```

**Context:** The `system-integration` repo orchestrates this node via Docker Compose and shardctl. It has a 6-phase migration plan (see `system-integration/docs/migration-to-rust-node.md`) to make f1r3node-rust the sole node implementation. Phase 1 requires genesis and compose alignment in this repo.

**Scope:**
- Genesis wallets.txt sync (critical blocker for system-integration Phase 1)
- Compose env var and network name standardization
- Validation that shard starts correctly

**Notes:**
- system-integration currently targets branch `dev` in its services.yml, but this repo uses `master` as its working branch. system-integration will need to update its branch reference.
- standalone.yml keeps its own network name (`f1r3fly-standalone`) since it's isolated by design.

### EPOCH-002: Separate Monitoring from Shard Compose

```yaml

epoch_id: EPOCH-002
title: "Separate Monitoring from Shard Compose"

    status: complete
    claimed_by: claude-session-epoch009
    completed_at: 2026-04-13T21:35:00Z
    acceptance:
      - "docker/monitoring.yml contains prometheus and grafana services"
      - "monitoring.yml joins f1r3fly-shard as external network"
      - "shard.yml no longer contains prometheus/grafana services"
      - "docker/README.md updated to reflect new file"
    notes:
      - "Verbatim service-block move; same container names, ports, volumes, env"
      - "Also updated Justfile shard-down to include monitoring.yml teardown"
      - "Also updated docker/vps-cloud-testing.md Part A to reflect opt-in monitoring"
---
```

**Context:** system-integration manages monitoring as a separate compose file (`compose/monitoring.yml`). Aligning this repo's structure makes compose files directly usable as upstream sources during the migration (Phase 3).

**Scope:**
- Move prometheus and grafana service definitions from `docker/shard.yml` to `docker/monitoring.yml`
- Update documentation

    status: pending
    acceptance:

    acceptance:
      - "#466 (Embers) reviewed — merged or deferred"
      - "#186 (eval cost) reviewed — merged or deferred"
      - "#281 (LMDB fixes) reviewed — merged or deferred"

    title: "Tag final f1r3node release"
    status: pending
    blocked_by: [TASK-003-2, TASK-003-3]
    acceptance:
      - "Tag rust-v0.4.12 (or appropriate version) created on f1r3node rust/dev"
      - "phase_1_critical_prs.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
      - "phase_1_critical_prs.final_tag populated"
---
```

**Context:** The Reified RSpaces chain (#328-#338) is a major architectural change that must land before code sync. This phase is owned by the agent working in the f1r3node repository. Completion is signaled via the shared migration plan file.

**Scope:**
- Included: Merging blocking and ready PRs into f1r3node rust/dev
- Excluded: Any work in f1r3node-rust (that starts in EPOCH-004)

**Notes:**
- The 11-PR Reified RSpaces chain has a sequential dependency — each PR targets the previous one
- Chain base (#328) depends on `new_parser` branch which depends on `rholang-rs#83`
- Monitor `/tmp/migrationPlan.md` for `phase_1_critical_prs.status` to know when to start EPOCH-004

      - "phase_2_code_sync.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
      - "phase_2_code_sync.synced_from_commit populated"
---
```

**Context:** Brings f1r3node-rust to full parity with post-merge f1r3node rust/dev. This is the core migration step — after this, f1r3node-rust becomes the canonical source of truth.

**Scope:**
- Included: All Rust crates, CI/CD, Docker, scripts, local dev config, version tagging
- Excluded: Issue migration (EPOCH-005), external repo updates (EPOCH-006)

**Notes:**
- The code delta is ~4 releases (v0.4.9-v0.4.11) plus the critical PRs from EPOCH-003
- Docker image renamed from `f1r3fly-rust-node` to `f1r3fly-rust`
- Version drops the `rust-` tag prefix (no longer needed in a Rust-only repo)
- Run tests per-crate to avoid LMDB lock contention (see commit f2b4b5f)

      - "No changes needed (already independent)"
      - "phase_4_external.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
---
```

**Context:** Downstream consumers need to point at the new repo and Docker image name. system-integration and pyf1r3fly are the primary consumers. rholang-rs is already independent.

**Scope:**
- Included: system-integration, pyf1r3fly, rholang-rs verification
- Excluded: Any other F1R3FLY-io repos not listed

**Scope:**
- Included: README update, repo metadata, CI disable, archive
- Excluded: Any further development in f1r3node

**Notes:**
- Do NOT archive until Phases 5-7 are confirmed complete
- The other agent in f1r3node should NOT start this until signaled

      - "Parameterized for arbitrary validator count (not hardcoded to 3)"
      - "Emits load-summary.txt and p50/p95 latency report"
      - "just bench-latency HOST DURATION wraps the script"
      - "scripts/bench/profile-casper-latency.sh ported for Rust node log format"

```

**Context:** Stands up a realistic multi-host deployment (single shard distributed across 2 VPSes) to measure network-latency-bound consensus performance. This is distinct from in-process or single-host Docker tests — it exercises the P2P transport, Kademlia discovery, and Casper finalization under real inter-host latency.

**Scope:**
- Included: OCI provisioning, image distribution, distributed compose, deploy/teardown automation, latency benchmark port
- Excluded: Inter-shard consensus (Option B, ~1,500+ LOC of consensus work — see BACKLOG-FI-001)
- Excluded: Non-OCI providers (Tata cloud, etc.)
- Excluded: Throughput, chaos, or whiteblock-plan benchmarks (future epochs)
- Excluded: Production-grade secrets management (using `scp` for TLS keys for now)

**Notes:**
- Uses arm64 (VM.Standard.A1.Flex) for free-tier eligibility and production representativeness
- Image distribution intentionally uses `docker save/load` rather than registry pull, to keep this epoch self-contained until the OCIR CI switch lands
- TLS keys for bootstrap are shipped via `scp` (acceptable for a throwaway testbed)

## Task States

| Status | Meaning | Next Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `pending` | Not started | Available to claim |
| `in_progress` | Being worked on | Continue or handoff |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependency | Check `blocked_by` |
| `review` | Ready for review | Review and approve |
| `complete` | Done | Move to CompletedTasks.md |

---

## Workflow

1. **Find next task**: Use `/nextTask` to identify the highest priority unclaimed task
2. **Claim task**: Set `claimed_by` and `status: in_progress`
3. **Implement**: Use `/implement` to execute with full context
4. **Complete**: Mark `status: complete` when acceptance criteria met
5. **Signal**: Update completion signals in `/tmp/migrationPlan.md`
6. **Move epoch**: When all tasks complete, move epoch to `docs/CompletedTasks.md`
