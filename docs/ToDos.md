    status: complete
    claimed_by: claude-session-epic009
    completed_at: 2026-04-13T20:55:00Z
    blocked_by: []
    acceptance:

      - "Genesis ceremony completes with 20-wallet wallets.txt"
      - "Observer and validator4 can join via f1r3fly-shard network"
    notes:
      - "All 3 written ACs verified end-to-end with locally built f1r3fly-rust:local image"
      - "Bonding extension also verified: added validator4's REV address (1111La6tHaCt...jtEi3M) to wallets.txt as genesis funding, then deployed bond.rho signed by validator4, propose included in block with errored=false and cost=167749 phlo, bond-status flipped to 'Validator is bonded', validator4 proceeded to produce 6+ blocks via heartbeat"
      - "Root cause of earlier insufficient-funds error: validator4.yml was designed for runtime bonding but validator4's REV address was never added to genesis wallets.txt. Fix is a single-line addition."
      - "REV-address computation done via `node eval` on 1.know_ones_vaultaddress.rho (output in docker stdout of the evaluating node)"
---
```

**Context:** The `system-integration` repo orchestrates this node via Docker Compose and shardctl. It has a 6-phase migration plan (see `system-integration/docs/migration-to-rust-node.md`) to make f1r3node-rust the sole node implementation. Phase 1 requires genesis and compose alignment in this repo.

**Scope:**
- Genesis wallets.txt sync (critical blocker for system-integration Phase 1)
- Compose env var and network name standardization
- Validation that shard starts correctly

**Notes:**
- system-integration currently targets branch `dev` in its services.yml, but this repo uses `master` as its working branch. system-integration will need to update its branch reference.
- standalone.yml keeps its own network name (`f1r3fly-standalone`) since it's isolated by design.

### EPIC-002: Separate Monitoring from Shard Compose

```yaml

epic_id: EPIC-002

    title: "Extract Prometheus and Grafana into docker/monitoring.yml"
    status: complete
    claimed_by: claude-session-epic009
    completed_at: 2026-04-13T21:35:00Z
    acceptance:
      - "docker/monitoring.yml contains prometheus and grafana services"
      - "monitoring.yml joins f1r3fly-shard as external network"
      - "shard.yml no longer contains prometheus/grafana services"
      - "docker/README.md updated to reflect new file"
    notes:
      - "Verbatim service-block move; same container names, ports, volumes, env"
      - "Also updated Justfile shard-down to include monitoring.yml teardown"
      - "Also updated docker/vps-cloud-testing.md Part A to reflect opt-in monitoring"
---
```

**Context:** system-integration manages monitoring as a separate compose file (`compose/monitoring.yml`). Aligning this repo's structure makes compose files directly usable as upstream sources during the migration (Phase 3).

**Scope:**
- Move prometheus and grafana service definitions from `docker/shard.yml` to `docker/monitoring.yml`
- Update documentation

      - "phase_1_critical_prs.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
      - "phase_1_critical_prs.final_tag populated"
---
```

**Context:** The Reified RSpaces chain (#328-#338) is a major architectural change that must land before code sync. This phase is owned by the agent working in the f1r3node repository. Completion is signaled via the shared migration plan file.

**Scope:**
- Included: Merging blocking and ready PRs into f1r3node rust/dev
- Excluded: Any work in f1r3node-rust (that starts in EPIC-004)

**Notes:**
- The 11-PR Reified RSpaces chain has a sequential dependency — each PR targets the previous one
- Chain base (#328) depends on `new_parser` branch which depends on `rholang-rs#83`
- Monitor `/tmp/migrationPlan.md` for `phase_1_critical_prs.status` to know when to start EPIC-004

      - "phase_2_code_sync.synced_from_commit populated"
---
```

**Context:** Brings f1r3node-rust to full parity with post-merge f1r3node rust/dev. This is the core migration step — after this, f1r3node-rust becomes the canonical source of truth.

**Scope:**
- Included: All Rust crates, CI/CD, Docker, scripts, local dev config, version tagging
- Excluded: Issue migration (EPIC-005), external repo updates (EPIC-006)

**Notes:**
- The code delta is ~4 releases (v0.4.9-v0.4.11) plus the critical PRs from EPIC-003
- Docker image renamed from `f1r3fly-rust-node` to `f1r3fly-rust`
- Version drops the `rust-` tag prefix (no longer needed in a Rust-only repo)
- Run tests per-crate to avoid LMDB lock contention (see commit f2b4b5f)

      - "phase_3_issues.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
    notes:
      - "#184 from the original spec was already closed pre-migration (unrelated genesis refactor), so effective count is 4 Scala + 1 already-fixed (#437) = 5 closures"
---
```

**Context:** Transfer the 27 open issues from f1r3node to their appropriate destinations. 22 issues migrate to f1r3node-rust, 5 Scala-only issues are closed.

**Scope:**
- Included: Issue creation, cross-referencing, closing Scala issues
- Excluded: Fixing any of the migrated issues

**Context:** Final step — makes f1r3node read-only and redirects all traffic to f1r3node-rust. This must not happen until all issues, PRs, and external repos are handled.

**Scope:**
- Included: README update, repo metadata, CI disable, archive
- Excluded: Any further development in f1r3node

**Notes:**
- Do NOT archive until Phases 5-7 are confirmed complete
- The other agent in f1r3node should NOT start this until signaled

```

**Context:** Stands up a realistic multi-host deployment (single shard distributed across 2 VPSes) to measure network-latency-bound consensus performance. This is distinct from in-process or single-host Docker tests — it exercises the P2P transport, Kademlia discovery, and Casper finalization under real inter-host latency.

**Scope:**
- Included: OCI provisioning, image distribution, distributed compose, deploy/teardown automation, latency benchmark port
- Excluded: Inter-shard consensus (Option B, ~1,500+ LOC of consensus work — see BACKLOG-FI-001)
- Excluded: Non-OCI providers (Tata cloud, etc.)
- Excluded: Throughput, chaos, or whiteblock-plan benchmarks (future epics)
- Excluded: Production-grade secrets management (using `scp` for TLS keys for now)

**Notes:**
- Uses arm64 (VM.Standard.A1.Flex) for free-tier eligibility and production representativeness
- Image distribution intentionally uses `docker save/load` rather than registry pull, to keep this epic self-contained until the OCIR CI switch lands
- TLS keys for bootstrap are shipped via `scp` (acceptable for a throwaway testbed)

      - "merge-recovery-soak.yml's SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_REF is covered by build_base's pin-drift check, alongside .github/oci-validation.env and _integration-pipeline.yml. It is a THIRD pin site that nobody knew existed: CI's pin advanced to 06f2020c while the soak's sat at a50eeb19, which predated system-integration 81284fc (adding integration-tests/certs/validator4). compose.py bind-mounts that path, so Docker created a directory and every node died on 'Failed to read the X.509 certificate: IO error: Is a directory (os error 21)'. Fixed for now by 4879a1f6; the guard is what stops it recurring."
      - "A schedule-gate no-op is distinguishable from a real pass without opening the run. Two cron slots fire nightly; the 19:30 Pacific slot runs the real soak and the 20:30 slot no-ops and reports success. From 2026-07-27 the real soak failed at bring-up every night while the workflow showed green, because the no-op is the later run. The job already prints a ::notice saying no soak was attempted — that is not enough, since the signal people read is the check mark."
      - "Regression coverage: the soak runs integration-tests/test/tests/custom/test_load.py, which the CI integration matrix explicitly --deselects. Any test only the soak runs needs either CI coverage or an explicit note that the soak is its sole gate, otherwise CI stays green through soak-only breakage."

```

**Context:** Implements US-004 plus the delivery/reporting design agreed 2026-07-15: the 72h soak concludes Mondays (weekly cadence); metrics are published to a GitHub Pages trend dashboard (pull) and a plain-text ONS email (push); regressions gate releases. Full design rationale, alternatives considered (email-only, Discussions, bot-committed reports), and open questions are in `docs/work-logs/task-EPIC-010-2026-07-15T20-57Z.md`.

**Scope:**
- Included: metrics emission, resource sampling, compare+gate, Pages dashboard, ONS email
- Excluded: PR #72 residual par-serialization benchmarking (separate concern)
- Excluded: HTML email formatting (ONS is plain-text; detail lives on the dashboard)
