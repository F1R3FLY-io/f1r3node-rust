### EPOCH-001: System-Integration Alignment

```yaml
---
epoch_id: EPOCH-001
title: "System-Integration Alignment"
status: in_progress
priority: p1
user_story: US-001
blocked_by: []
created_at: 2026-03-19
claimed_by: null
claimed_at: null
tasks:
  - id: TASK-001-1
    title: "Align genesis wallets.txt with system-integration (20 wallets, validator3=500T)"
    status: complete
    acceptance:
      - "docker/genesis/wallets.txt matches system-integration/genesis/wallets.txt (20 lines)"
      - "Validator3 balance is 500000000000000000 (500T)"
      - "All 12 additional test wallets present"

  - id: TASK-001-2
    title: "Standardize compose env var naming (F1R3FLY_RUST_IMAGE -> F1R3FLY_IMAGE)"
    status: complete
    acceptance:
      - "All compose files use F1R3FLY_IMAGE instead of F1R3FLY_RUST_IMAGE"
      - "DEVELOPER.md and docker/README.md updated"

  - id: TASK-001-3
    title: "Standardize Docker network name to f1r3fly-shard"
    status: complete
    acceptance:
      - "shard.yml network named f1r3fly-shard"
      - "observer.yml and validator4.yml reference f1r3fly-shard as external network"

  - id: TASK-001-4
    title: "Verify shard starts with updated genesis and network config"
    status: pending
    blocked_by: []
    acceptance:
      - "docker compose -f docker/shard.yml up succeeds"
      - "Genesis ceremony completes with 20-wallet wallets.txt"
      - "Observer and validator4 can join via f1r3fly-shard network"
---
```

**Context:** The `system-integration` repo orchestrates this node via Docker Compose and shardctl. It has a 6-phase migration plan (see `system-integration/docs/migration-to-rust-node.md`) to make f1r3node-rust the sole node implementation. Phase 1 requires genesis and compose alignment in this repo.

**Scope:**
- Genesis wallets.txt sync (critical blocker for system-integration Phase 1)
- Compose env var and network name standardization
- Validation that shard starts correctly

**Notes:**
- system-integration currently targets branch `dev` in its services.yml, but this repo uses `master` as its working branch. system-integration will need to update its branch reference.
- standalone.yml keeps its own network name (`f1r3fly-standalone`) since it's isolated by design.

### EPOCH-002: Separate Monitoring from Shard Compose

```yaml
---
epoch_id: EPOCH-002
title: "Separate Monitoring from Shard Compose"
status: pending
priority: p2
user_story: US-001
blocked_by: []
created_at: 2026-03-19
claimed_by: null
claimed_at: null
tasks:
  - id: TASK-002-1
    title: "Extract Prometheus and Grafana into docker/monitoring.yml"
    status: pending
    acceptance:
      - "docker/monitoring.yml contains prometheus and grafana services"
      - "monitoring.yml joins f1r3fly-shard as external network"
      - "shard.yml no longer contains prometheus/grafana services"
      - "docker/README.md updated to reflect new file"
---
```

**Context:** system-integration manages monitoring as a separate compose file (`compose/monitoring.yml`). Aligning this repo's structure makes compose files directly usable as upstream sources during the migration (Phase 3).

**Scope:**
- Move prometheus and grafana service definitions from `docker/shard.yml` to `docker/monitoring.yml`
- Update documentation

### EPOCH-003: Merge Critical PRs into f1r3node

```yaml

external: true
external_repo: F1R3FLY-io/f1r3node
coordination_note: "This epoch is executed by the agent in f1r3node. Track progress via /tmp/migrationPlan.md phase_1_critical_prs status."
tasks:
  - id: TASK-003-1
    title: "Verify new_parser branch status"
    status: pending
    acceptance:
      - "new_parser branch is merged into rust/dev OR confirmed as base for Reified RSpaces chain"
      - "rholang-rs#83 dependency is resolved"

  - id: TASK-003-2
    title: "Merge Reified RSpaces chain (#328-#338)"
    status: pending
    blocked_by: [TASK-003-1]
    acceptance:
      - "All 11 PRs (#328 through #338) merged sequentially into rust/dev"
      - "CI passes after each merge"

  - id: TASK-003-3
    title: "Merge Tier 2 PRs if ready"
    status: pending
    acceptance:
      - "#466 (Embers) reviewed — merged or deferred"
      - "#186 (eval cost) reviewed — merged or deferred"
      - "#281 (LMDB fixes) reviewed — merged or deferred"

  - id: TASK-003-4
    title: "Tag final f1r3node release"
    status: pending
    blocked_by: [TASK-003-2, TASK-003-3]
    acceptance:
      - "Tag rust-v0.4.12 (or appropriate version) created on f1r3node rust/dev"
      - "phase_1_critical_prs.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
      - "phase_1_critical_prs.final_tag populated"
---
```

**Context:** The Reified RSpaces chain (#328-#338) is a major architectural change that must land before code sync. This phase is owned by the agent working in the f1r3node repository. Completion is signaled via the shared migration plan file.

**Scope:**
- Included: Merging blocking and ready PRs into f1r3node rust/dev
- Excluded: Any work in f1r3node-rust (that starts in EPOCH-004)

**Notes:**
- The 11-PR Reified RSpaces chain has a sequential dependency — each PR targets the previous one
- Chain base (#328) depends on `new_parser` branch which depends on `rholang-rs#83`
- Monitor `/tmp/migrationPlan.md` for `phase_1_critical_prs.status` to know when to start EPOCH-004

---

### EPOCH-004: Code Sync to f1r3node-rust

```yaml
---
epoch_id: EPOCH-004
title: "Code Sync to f1r3node-rust"

    acceptance:
      - "scripts/version.sh ported"
      - "scripts/clean_rust_libraries.sh ported"
      - "scripts/delete_data.sh ported"
      - "scripts/run_rust_tests.sh ported"

  - id: TASK-004-5
    title: "Set version and create initial tag"
    status: pending
    blocked_by: [TASK-004-1, TASK-004-2]
    acceptance:
      - "node/Cargo.toml version continues from f1r3node's last release"
      - "Tag v0.4.12 (or matching version) created on f1r3node-rust"
      - "phase_2_code_sync.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
      - "phase_2_code_sync.synced_from_commit populated"
---
```

**Context:** Brings f1r3node-rust to full parity with post-merge f1r3node rust/dev. This is the core migration step — after this, f1r3node-rust becomes the canonical source of truth.

**Scope:**
- Included: All Rust crates, CI/CD, Docker, scripts, local dev config, version tagging
- Excluded: Issue migration (EPOCH-005), external repo updates (EPOCH-006)

**Notes:**
- The code delta is ~4 releases (v0.4.9-v0.4.11) plus the critical PRs from EPOCH-003
- Docker image renamed from `f1r3fly-rust-node` to `f1r3fly-rust`
- Version drops the `rust-` tag prefix (no longer needed in a Rust-only repo)
- Run tests per-crate to avoid LMDB lock contention (see commit f2b4b5f)

      - "No changes needed (already independent)"
      - "phase_4_external.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
---
```

**Context:** Downstream consumers need to point at the new repo and Docker image name. system-integration and pyf1r3fly are the primary consumers. rholang-rs is already independent.

**Scope:**
- Included: system-integration, pyf1r3fly, rholang-rs verification
- Excluded: Any other F1R3FLY-io repos not listed

      - "PRs closed on f1r3node"
      - "phase_5_pr_cleanup.status set to 'complete' in /tmp/migrationPlan.md"
---
```

**Context:** All open PRs on f1r3node must be resolved. Tier 3 PRs (viable Rust work) get redirect instructions. Tier 4 PRs (Scala) are closed with deprecation notice.

**Scope:**
- Included: Commenting and closing PRs on f1r3node
- Excluded: Tier 1/2 PRs (handled in EPOCH-003)

---
```

**Context:** Final step — makes f1r3node read-only and redirects all traffic to f1r3node-rust. This must not happen until all issues, PRs, and external repos are handled.

**Scope:**
- Included: README update, repo metadata, CI disable, archive
- Excluded: Any further development in f1r3node

**Notes:**
- Do NOT archive until Phases 5-7 are confirmed complete
- The other agent in f1r3node should NOT start this until signaled

---
```

**Context:** Stands up a realistic multi-host deployment (single shard distributed across 2 VPSes) to measure network-latency-bound consensus performance. This is distinct from in-process or single-host Docker tests — it exercises the P2P transport, Kademlia discovery, and Casper finalization under real inter-host latency.

**Scope:**
- Included: OCI provisioning, image distribution, distributed compose, deploy/teardown automation, latency benchmark port
- Excluded: Inter-shard consensus (Option B, ~1,500+ LOC of consensus work — see BACKLOG-FI-001)
- Excluded: Non-OCI providers (Tata cloud, etc.)
- Excluded: Throughput, chaos, or whiteblock-plan benchmarks (future epochs)
- Excluded: Production-grade secrets management (using `scp` for TLS keys for now)

**Notes:**
- Uses arm64 (VM.Standard.A1.Flex) for free-tier eligibility and production representativeness
- Image distribution intentionally uses `docker save/load` rather than registry pull, to keep this epoch self-contained until the OCIR CI switch lands
- TLS keys for bootstrap are shipped via `scp` (acceptable for a throwaway testbed)

2. **Claim task**: Set `claimed_by` and `status: in_progress`
3. **Implement**: Use `/implement` to execute with full context
4. **Complete**: Mark `status: complete` when acceptance criteria met
5. **Signal**: Update completion signals in `/tmp/migrationPlan.md`
6. **Move epoch**: When all tasks complete, move epoch to `docs/CompletedTasks.md`
