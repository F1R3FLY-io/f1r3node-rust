# User Stories

This document captures user stories that drive feature development. User stories are reverse-engineered from completed epochs and updated as new features are planned.

**Document Structure**
- Active stories: This file (`docs/UserStories.md`)
- Implementation tracking: `docs/ToDos.md` (epochs and tasks)
- Completed work: `docs/CompletedTasks.md`

**Format:** Each story follows the standard template:
> As a [persona], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

## Planned Stories

#### US-001: System-Integration Compatibility

> As a **platform operator**, I want **f1r3node-rust's Docker configuration to be directly compatible with the system-integration orchestration tooling** so that **the migration from dual Scala/Rust support to Rust-only can proceed without manual fixups**.

**Implemented in:** EPOCH-001, EPOCH-002

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Genesis wallets.txt identical between repos (20 wallets, correct balances)
- [x] Docker image env var standardized to `F1R3FLY_IMAGE`
- [x] Shard network name standardized to `f1r3fly-shard`
- [ ] Monitoring separated into its own compose file (matches system-integration pattern)
- [ ] Shard verified to start with updated configuration
- [ ] system-integration's `services.yml` can point to this repo's `master` branch

**Completed:** Planned

## Relationship to Epochs

User stories capture the **why** (user need and benefit). Epochs capture the **what** (technical implementation tasks).

| Artifact | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| User Story | Business/user need | `docs/UserStories.md` |
| Epoch | Implementation scope | `docs/ToDos.md` |
| Task | Technical work item | Nested in epoch YAML |
| Acceptance Criteria | Definition of done | In user story |

**Workflow:**
1. Identify user need -> Create user story
2. Design solution -> Create epoch with tasks
3. Implement -> Work through tasks via `/nextTask` and `/implement`
4. Complete -> Mark epoch complete, update story status
