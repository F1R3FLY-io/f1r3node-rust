# SETUP

If you've run RNode previously, delete the pre-existing configuration files.

    rm -rf ~/.rnode/
    
From the `rchain` directory, build RNode.

    sbt node/universal:stage
    
From `node/target/universal/stage`, start RNode.

    ./bin/rnode run -s --wallets-file $HOME/IdeaProjects/rchain/rholang/examples/wallets.txt
    
This generates a random Secp256k1 private key corresponding to a validator. Next, terminate RNode and restart as one of 
the randomly generated validators.

    ./bin/rnode run -s --validator-private-key $(cat ~/.rnode/genesis/*.sk | tail -1) --wallets-file $HOME/IdeaProjects/rchain/rholang/examples/wallets.txt

Open a new terminal and navigate to `rholang/examples`, then add simulated user credentials to bash environment.

# DEMO START

## Know your VaultAddress

Here's how Alice would check her vault address:

    ./propose.sh $ALICE_PRV vault_demo/1.know_ones_vaultaddress.rho "-e s/%PUB_KEY/$ALICE_PUB/"

## Access your own vault

Here's how Alice would check her vault balance:

    ./propose.sh $ALICE_PRV vault_demo/2.check_balance.rho "-e s/%VAULT_ADDR/$ALICE_VAULT/"
        
Notice that anyone can check Alice's vault balance.

    ./propose.sh $BOB_PRV vault_demo/2.check_balance.rho "-e s/%VAULT_ADDR/$ALICE_VAULT/"

## Transfer to a VaultAddress

Suppose Alice wants to on-board Bob and that she knows his vault address. Here's how she would transfer 100 tokens to Bob.

    ./propose.sh $ALICE_PRV vault_demo/3.transfer_funds.rho "-e s/%FROM/$ALICE_VAULT/ -e s/%TO/$BOB_VAULT/"
    ./propose.sh $ALICE_PRV vault_demo/2.check_balance.rho "-e s/%VAULT_ADDR/$ALICE_VAULT/"
    
Notice the transfer hasn't been finished yet. Still, funds have been deducted from Alice's vault.

Now, let's have Bob check his own balance:

    ./propose.sh $BOB_PRV vault_demo/2.check_balance.rho "-e s/%VAULT_ADDR/$BOB_VAULT/"

When Bob checks his balance for the first time, a vault is created at the vault address he provides. Once his vault is 
created, all previous transfers to his vault complete. In other words, the order in which one creates a vault and transfers
funds into that vault doesn't matter.

This means that the first access to one's vault needs to be done by a 3rd-party having the funds
to pay for it. So the exchanges should not only do a `transfer`, but also a `findOrCreate`
the destination vault. So should the Testnet operators distributing the funds.

Because the "transfer" method takes a VaultAddress (and not a SystemVault), transfers between different "kinds", or security 
schemes of SystemVaults are possible. For now, we only provide a simple SystemVault that only grants access to its designated 
user.

## Attempt a transfer despite insufficient funds

    ./propose.sh $ALICE_PRV vault_demo/3.transfer_funds.rho "-e s/%FROM/$ALICE_VAULT/ -e s/%TO/$BOB_VAULT/"

## Attempt a transfer despite invalid VaultAddress

    ./propose.sh $ALICE_PRV vault_demo/3.transfer_funds.rho "-e s/%FROM/$ALICE_VAULT/ -e s/%TO/lala/"

Notice the platform only checks whether the address is syntactically correct. A typo means the funds are lost.
