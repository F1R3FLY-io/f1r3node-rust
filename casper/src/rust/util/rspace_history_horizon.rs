//! Forward-horizon rspace history reachability calculation.
//!
//! Used by joiner-side LFS sync to determine which rspace post-state roots
//! must be in the joiner's local roots store before transitioning to Running.
//! The calculation is the inverse of `mergeable_channels_gc::is_safe_to_delete`:
//! whereas the GC computes "what's safe to forget," this computes "what's
//! still reachable as a parent of an upcoming proposal."
//!
//! A joiner that has just LFS-synced to LFB at height N needs rspace state
//! for every block that an honest proposer could legitimately reference as
//! a parent: the proposer-side `Estimator::filterDeepParents` filter permits
//! any block within `max_parent_depth + depth_buffer` from the highest tip.
//! For a joiner whose highest tip is the LFB (just after sync), that means
//! every block in the DAG with `height ≥ LFB.height − (max_parent_depth +
//! depth_buffer)` — main chain AND side branches.
//!
//! The validator-side parent-depth check in `validate::parents` rejects any
//! block whose parents fall outside this same horizon, so the set of
//! potentially-validatable blocks is exactly bounded by it. There is no
//! out-of-horizon case to handle: horizon-internal blocks have their roots
//! synced by `sync_forward_horizon`, and out-of-horizon blocks are rejected
//! on consensus rules before validation queries the rspace history.
//!
//! For each in-horizon block we emit BOTH `pre_state_hash` and
//! `post_state_hash`. Single-parent blocks have `pre_state_hash =
//! parent.post_state_hash`, so this is mostly a redundant restatement of
//! a hash that's already collected from the parent. For multi-parent
//! blocks, however, `pre_state_hash` is the merge result computed by the
//! proposer's `dag_merger::merge` via `apply_trie_actions_fn` →
//! `do_checkpoint`'s `store_root`. That merge intermediate is recorded in
//! the proposer's roots_store but is NOT any block's post-state, so a
//! joiner that only collects post-states is left without it. When the
//! joiner later attempts to replay a child of one of those merged blocks
//! (or processes a parallel sibling), the spawn/reset path validates the
//! merge-result root against the joiner's roots_store and fires
//! `RootRepositoryDivergence` if absent. Including pre-states closes
//! that gap — peers serve the radix history for these merge results
//! because their `do_checkpoint` already wrote the trie nodes plus the
//! root tag for them.
